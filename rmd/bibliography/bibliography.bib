In particular, this article focuses on maximum likelihood estimation and presents two analysis examples from the Longitudinal Study of American Youth data.

  Abstract                 = {Our understanding of the mechanisms by which nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) progresses from simple steatosis to steatohepatitis (NASH) is still very limited. Despite the growing number of studies linking the disease with altered serum metabolite levels, an obstacle to the development of metabolome-based NAFLD predictors has been the lack of large cohort data from biopsy-proven patients matched for key metabolic features such as obesity. We studied 467 biopsied individuals with normal liver histology (n=90) or diagnosed with NAFLD (steatosis, n=246; NASH, n=131), randomly divided into estimation (80\% of all patients) and validation (20\% of all patients) groups. Qualitative determinations of 540 serum metabolite variables were performed using ultraperformance liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS). The metabolic profile was dependent on patient body-mass index (BMI), suggesting that the NAFLD pathogenesis mechanism may be quite different depending on an individual's level of obesity. A BMI-stratified multivariate model based on the NAFLD serum metabolic profile was used to separate patients with and without NASH. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.87 in the estimation and 0.85 in the validation group. The cutoff (0.54) corresponding to maximum average diagnostic accuracy (0.82) predicted NASH with a sensitivity of 0.71 and a specificity of 0.92 (negative/positive predictive values=0.82/0.84). The present data, indicating that a BMI-dependent serum metabolic profile may be able to reliably distinguish NASH from steatosis patients, have significant implications for the development of NASH biomarkers and potential novel targets for therapeutic intervention.},

  Abstract                 = {Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common form of chronic liver disease in most western countries. Current NAFLD diagnosis methods (e.g., liver biopsy analysis or imaging techniques) are poorly suited as tests for such a prevalent condition, from both a clinical and financial point of view. The present work aims to demonstrate the potential utility of serum metabolic profiling in defining phenotypic biomarkers that could be useful in NAFLD management. A parallel animal model/human NAFLD exploratory metabolomics approach was employed, using ultra performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) to analyze 42 serum samples collected from nondiabetic, morbidly obese, biopsy-proven NAFLD patients, and 17 animals belonging to the glycine N-methyltransferase knockout (GNMT-KO) NAFLD mouse model. Multivariate statistical analysis of the data revealed a series of common biomarkers that were significantly altered in the NAFLD (GNMT-KO) subjects in comparison to their normal liver counterparts (WT). Many of the compounds observed could be associated with biochemical perturbations associated with liver dysfunction (e.g., reduced Creatine) and inflammation (e.g., eicosanoid signaling). This differential metabolic phenotyping approach may have a future role as a supplement for clinical decision making in NAFLD and in the adaption to more individualized treatment protocols.},

  Abstract                 = {Extracting relevant biological information from large data sets is a major challenge in functional genomics research. Different aspects of the data hamper their biological interpretation. For instance, 5000-fold differences in concentration for different metabolites are present in a metabolomics data set, while these differences are not proportional to the biological relevance of these metabolites. However, data analysis methods are not able to make this distinction. Data pretreatment methods can correct for aspects that hinder the biological interpretation of metabolomics data sets by emphasizing the biological information in the data set and thus improving their biological interpretability.Different data pretreatment methods, i.e. centering, autoscaling, pareto scaling, range scaling, vast scaling, log transformation, and power transformation, were tested on a real-life metabolomics data set. They were found to greatly affect the outcome of the data analysis and thus the rank of the, from a biological point of view, most important metabolites. Furthermore, the stability of the rank, the influence of technical errors on data analysis, and the preference of data analysis methods for selecting highly abundant metabolites were affected by the data pretreatment method used prior to data analysis.Different pretreatment methods emphasize different aspects of the data and each pretreatment method has its own merits and drawbacks. The choice for a pretreatment method depends on the biological question to be answered, the properties of the data set and the data analysis method selected. For the explorative analysis of the validation data set used in this study, autoscaling and range scaling performed better than the other pretreatment methods. That is, range scaling and autoscaling were able to remove the dependence of the rank of the metabolites on the average concentration and the magnitude of the fold changes and showed biologically sensible results after PCA (principal component analysis).In conclusion, selecting a proper data pretreatment method is an essential step in the analysis of metabolomics data and greatly affects the metabolites that are identified to be the most important.},

Practical missing data analysis issues are discussed, most notably the inclusion of auxiliary variables for improving power and reducing bias. Solutions are given for missing data challenges such as handling longitudinal, categorical, and clustered data with normal-model MI; including interactions in the missing data model; and handling large numbers of variables. The discussion of attrition and nonignorable missingness emphasizes the need for longitudinal diagnostics and for reducing the uncertainty about the missing data mechanism under attrition. Strategies suggested for reducing attrition bias include using auxiliary variables, collecting follow-up data on a sample of those initially missing, and collecting data on intent to drop out. Suggestions are given for moving forward with research on missing data and attrition.},

  Abstract                 = {There have been considerable improvements in therapeutics for chronic diseases. However, the maximum benefit of these or other options are hard to achieve in practice, due in part to the difficulties associated with determining optimal targets for such interventions. Recent developments have suggested that understanding changes in metabolite profiles will confer a high degree of predictive accuracy in terms of understanding the fundamental mechanisms resulting in perturbations of the metabolic state. Metabolomics involves the establishment of relationships between phenotype and a metabolic signature, which are key aspects of biological function. These approaches have been applied to the identification of serum/plasma metabolic markers involved in obesity, diabetes and vascular disease using animal models or in humans. Different kinds of metabolite profiling techniques using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, ultraperformance liquid chromatography and so on are currently employed to generate global metabolic profiles. Scientific information derived from these techniques can be applied to provide accurate and clinically useful prognostic/diagnostic capability for the management of major chronic diseases. One current consideration limiting the widespread use of metabolomic profiling is the analysis of its cost-effectiveness. In summary, it is hoped that the information derived from metabolite profiling will make it possible to suggest individualized therapies that more effectively treat disease.},

Either individually or grouped as a metabolomic profile, detection of metabolites is carried out in cells, tissues, or biofluids by either nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy or mass spectrometry. There is potential for the metabolome to have a multitude of uses in oncology, including the early detection and diagnosis of cancer and as both a predictive and pharmacodynamic marker of drug effect. Despite this, there is lack of knowledge in the oncology community regarding metabolomics and confusion about its methodologic processes, technical challenges, and clinical applications. Metabolomics, when used as a translational research tool, can provide a link between the laboratory and clinic, particularly because metabolic and molecular imaging technologies, such as positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging, enable the discrimination of metabolic markers noninvasively in vivo. Here, we review the current and potential applications of metabolomics, focusing on its use as a biomarker for cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic evaluation.},

  Abstract                 = {The pathophysiological changes associated with Alzheimer's Disease (AD) begin decades before the emergence of clinical symptoms. Understanding the early mechanisms associated with AD pathology is, therefore, especially important for identifying disease-modifying therapeutic targets. While the majority of AD clinical trials to date have focused on anti-amyloid-beta (A?) treatments, other therapeutic approaches may be necessary. The ability to monitor changes in cellular networks that include both A? and non-A? pathways is essential to advance our understanding of the etiopathogenesis of AD and subsequent development of cognitive symptoms and dementia. Metabolomics is a powerful tool that detects perturbations in the metabolome, a pool of metabolites that reflects changes downstream of genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic fluctuations, and represents an accurate biochemical profile of the organism in health and disease. The application of metabolomics could help to identify biomarkers for early AD diagnosis, to discover novel therapeutic targets, and to monitor therapeutic response and disease progression. Moreover, given the considerable parallel between mouse and human metabolism, the use of metabolomics provides ready translation of animal research into human studies for accelerated drug design. In this review, we will summarize current progress in the application of metabolomics in both animal models and in humans to further understanding of the mechanisms involved in AD pathogenesis.

  Abstract                 = {Random forests are a combination of tree predictors such that each tree depends on the values of a random vector sampled independently and with the same distribution for all trees in the forest. The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund \& R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148--156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.},

  abstract = {Metabolomic analysis of the urinary organic acids from 39 selected children with defined respiratory chain deficiencies (RCDs) was performed using untargeted gas chromatography--mass spectrometry, revealing the presence of 255 endogenous and 46 exogenous substances. Variable reduction identified 92 variables from the endogenous substances, which could be analysed by univariate and multivariate statistical methods. Using these methods, no characteristic organic acid biomarker profile could be defined of practical value for diagnostic purposes for complex I (CI), complex III (CIII) and multiple complex (CM) deficiencies. The statistical procedures used did, however, disclose 24 metabolites that were practical highly (d > 0.75) and statistically (P < 0.05) significant for the combined and clinically closely related group of RCDs. Several of these metabolites occur in single enzyme inherited metabolic diseases, but most were not previously reported to be linked to the metabolic perturbations that are due to RCDs. Ultimately, we constructed a global metabolic profile of carbohydrate, amino acid and fatty acid catabolism, illuminating the diverse and complex biochemical consequences of these disorders. This metabolomics investigation disclosed a metabolite profile that has the potential to define an extended and characteristic biosignature for RCDs and the development of a non-invasive screening procedure for these disorders.},

  Abstract                 = {Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a nervous system disease that affects the fatty myelin sheaths around the axons of the brain and spinal cord, leading to demyelination and a broad range of signs and symptoms. MS can be difficult to diagnose because its signs and symptoms may be similar to other medical problems. To find out which metabolites in serum are effective for the diagnosis of MS, we utilized metabolic profiling using proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-NMR). Random forest (RF) was used to classify the MS patients and healthy subjects. Atomic absorption spectroscopy was used to measure the serum levels of selenium. The results showed that the levels of selenium were lower in the MS group, when compared with the control group. RF was used to identify the metabolites that caused selenium changes in people with MS by building a correlation model between these metabolites and serum levels of selenium. For the external test set, the obtained classification model showed a 93\% correct classification of MS and healthy subjects. The regression model of levels of selenium and metabolites showed the correlation (R(2)) value of 0.88 for the external test set. The results indicate the suitability of NMR as a screen for identifying MS patients and healthy subjects. A novel model with good prediction outcomes was constructed between serum levels of selenium and NMR data.},
